Robot 1: Clothing consultant (Beginner)

A user enters a city name, the robot then scrapes Google for the temperature and weather in that city, the robot then processes the data and makes a decision which will then suggest a clothing type to the user.

Robot 2: Data capturing (Beginner)

A common daily task of a Data Capturer's life is copy-pasting data from an excel spreadsheet into a web or desktop application. 
This robot fully-automates that task. The robot copy-pastes 100 lines of customer data into their respective input fields of a web application and desktop application. The robot even performs both the web and desktop app data capturing simultaneously. This gets the job done in a fraction of the time that a human could with 100% accuracy.

Robot 3: Automation challenge (Intermediate)

This is an RPA challenge created by UiPath to test a RPA Developer's ability to build a robust software robot. 
The goal of this challenge is to create a workflow that will input data from a spreadsheet into the form fields on the screen. Beware! The fields will change position on the screen after every submission, throughout 10 rounds, thus the workflow must correctly identify where each spreadsheet record must be typed every time.

Robot 4: Real estate web scraping (Intermediate)

A user enters a city name, the robot then scrapes thousands of real estate listing data in that city off the web. 
The data is then exported into a MS Excel spreadsheet, including the prices of the property, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms and suburb location
